# MajorBonghits' Stardew Valley Mod Collection


## Background
This collection of mods are authored by myself, mostly for my own playthroughs, problem solving and closing gaps.

I started with frustration over Stardew Valley Expanded'd custom Bears in the Premium Barn. They acted similarly to truffle pigs, but once you get the honey from them that was it. I was dissapointed in the lack of artisan good for such unique honey, so I decided to make it!

The itch to tinker and 'fix' crept up on me, now we're here!
