# Stardew Galaxy

## Basic premise; 
    The player is introduced to a new NPC (Holden) who informs them a space ship has crash landed just outside stardew valley and tasks the player with assisting with cleaning up/repairing the wreckage. Through questing and work orders, the player will amass enough resources to repair the ship. Once the ship is repaired, the player can them add fuel to the ship and liftoff. once the player has lifted off they will be greeted with a window to choose where to go. Once the player decides on a destination, the ship will land and establish a 'base of operations' for the player which will act as an additional farm. Once the player has their 'base of operations' they can explore the new planet and its' surrounding area. The surrounding area will be the same as the vanilla assets, but recolored  to be alien-like (purple, pink, blue). The player will encounter enemies reskinned with SpaceCore - new crops - new forage - new minerals - new tool tier - new NPCs and new mysteries.
