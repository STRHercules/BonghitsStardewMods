# Artisanal Honey Mead
### General
* ~~Potentially remove ability to flavor mead until final stage of process. Stage 3 currently undeveloped. This stage could potentially take aged mead and sparkling mead - combine them with fruit into a mead spritzer? [*Strawberry, Grape and Melon Mead Spritzer]*~~

* ~~For stage three, simply ignore flavor definition and create *[Fruity Mead Spritzer]*? This option is kinda lame considering previous stages.~~

* Translation support 

* ~~Add mail system~~


### Carbonation
* ~~Carbonator requires Bubbles to craft. Currently sold from Natalie, make bubbles a byproduct of brewing mead.~~

* ~~Potentially use carbonation machine to make other beverages such as cider from apples~~

* ~~Carbonation machine - create sparkling mead. Additional second step in the mead refining process. Does not replace aging, works in tandem.~~

* ~~Currently using placeholder art for sparkling mead object~~

~~### Barrel Aging [Smoking]~~
* ~~Create Barrel Sprite~~

* ~~Potential Stage Three - Take your stage 2 Flavored Mead (Aged/Sparkling) and further age it in a smoked oaken barrel - this will add the 'smoked' effect to the sprite similar to smoked fish. Attempt the copy the cask operation? if not possible, use keg/jar operation and just make it take a long ass time~~

### Filtering
* Add new machine, filter/strainer that will filter particulates left behind from fruit.

* Byproducts from filtering can be sold/reused [Fruit, coal?]

* Need some kind of cheesecloth crafted from linen/yarn (Wool, Camel Wool)

* Cheesecloth will be used as a 'fuel' in the machine. Will consume your filter in the process
